    "In most NLP tasks, the initial step in preparing your data is to extract a vocabulary of words from your corpus (i.e. input texts). You will need to define how to represent the texts into numerical representations which can be used to train a neural network. These representations are called tokens and Tensorflow and Keras makes it easy to generate these using its APIs. You will see how to do that in the next cells\n",

    "In this notebook, you will look first at how you can provide a look up dictionary for each word. The code below takes a list of sentences, then takes each word in those sentences and assigns it to an integer. This is done using the fit_on_texts() method and you can get the result by looking at the word_index property. More frequent words have a lower index.\n"
